# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to understand and present the difference in fare volume and average fare the business can expect while operating in different types of cities.

## Results
![Pyber_fare_summary](https://github.com/pacefegley/PyBer_Analysis/assets/119641907/cdc5d115-e59a-4094-8050-bf3c0fd2b274)

In the chart above, we can see that the highest volume in fare revenue can be made in urban areas. There is a significant drop-off for suburban areas, and then again when we take a look at rural areas.

We can see in the table below that, while the statement above about revenue is true, the average fare per driver and per ride in rural and suburban areas is higher than in urban areas. This may be caused by increased competition in those areas (forcing our fares lower), or simply by the distance delta for rides in those city types. More analysis on these points is needed, but we may see higher profit margins in rural and suburban areas, even though the revenue is lower.

## Summary
### Business Recommendations Based on the Analysis

1. Attempt to raise fare prices in urban areas. With the volume in this city type being so high, this would have the greatest affect on revenue generation.
2. More marketing in rural areas. The average fare ride is very high, so driving up demand for our services in these areas can help to close the gap in lower ride volumes.
3. Attempt to get urban drivers to drive more often. There are more urban drivers than the total number of urban rides over this time period, which is a very concerning data point.
